# Vibe Meme Sound Board

This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates a meme sound board. It allows you to:

1. Choose and play a sound.
2. Mark sounds as favorites.
3. Filter by category.
4. Display an image for each meme sound.
5. Search for sounds by name.

Add your own sound and image files under the `assets/sounds/` and `assets/images/` directories. Both folders are tracked with an empty `.gitkeep` file so you can easily place your assets there and update the `SoundProvider` with your data.

## Getting Started

Run `flutter pub get` and launch the app on your preferred device:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
